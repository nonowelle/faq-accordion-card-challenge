# Frontend Mentor - FAQ Accordion Card

![Design preview for the FAQ Accordion Card coding challenge](./design/desktop-preview.jpg)

## Genereal Info
This was my third Front-End Mentor Challenge. I had to build out a FAQ accordion card and get it to look as close to the design as possible. I could use any tools I want to complete the task.

The users had to be able to: 
- View the optimal layout for the component depending on their device's screen size
- See hover states for all interactive elements on the page
- Hide/Show the answer to a question when the question is clicked
